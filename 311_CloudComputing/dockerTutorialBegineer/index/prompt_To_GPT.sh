i start learning the Docker completer in my college IITP cloud computing couserswork and creating the repo : C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP\311_CloudComputing\dockerTutorialBegineer\oneShot_ByApnaCollege.sh

i am beginner and start first time this, as i faced the earlier codes sharing issues while working on project ResearchKart      and Dcployrncnl & 1-csting: Deploying the platform and ensuring performance. scalability. and 
 using Hostinger. ( Deployed link: https://researchkart.in/




Q2. Docker i am asking to you file extension name: So, when you create the file, you just name it Dockerfile (without .txt, .sh, or any other extension). 
It should be in the root of your project directory (or wherever you are building the Docker image). No need to add an extension because Docker automatically recognizes it by name.



Q3. repo setup for docker

ok thanks

I want to set up this subfolder in the same GitHub repo C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP\311_CloudComputing\dockerTutorialBegineer
and also a separate branch for that, where I can push all the commits related to Docker learn exploring skills

Note: Be alert - this should not merge with my other rest branch, and push all learning skills in this docker-journey-devops branch only. and lastly merge with the main branch

This is below for your reference: my current working status
PS C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP> git branch           
* learn-os-linux
  main
PS C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP> git remote -v        
origin  https://ankit485803@github.com/ankit485803/Lab_IITP.git (fetch)
origin  https://ankit485803@github.com/ankit485803/Lab_IITP.git (push)
PS C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP> git config user.email
ankit485803@gmail.com
PS C:\Users\sanja\Desktop\GitProj\Lab_IITP> git config user.name

i want to change my docker pull IMAGE from c drive to D 

default setting i cause the storage full ok pls suggest 
 D:\LearnDocker\newFolder\DockerDesktopWSL
 

is this effort my system or not to run any other project if i will work in future bhai, beacue docker image is small size but I run the image and export the completed container that is very big, that why i want to do this

Q. when i pull any images from the docker hub to dokcer images though MNT WSL Linux terminal where that store in my laptop
Jab tu Docker Desktop (Windows + WSL2 backend) use karta hai aur Docker Hub se docker pull chalata hai (chahe PowerShell se ya WSL Linux terminal se), images hamesha ek hi jagah store hoti hain â†’ Docker Desktop ka disk image file.
Ye ek virtual disk file hai (ext4.vhdx) jisme:

Images
Containers
Volumes
Networks
sab kuch ek single Linux filesystem ke tarah store hota ha

Ans: but Ankit ke case mai nahi hoga hm change kar diye hai path to D drive mai sara chale jayega

download the Docker Desktop AMD 16

On the Docker site, you see two Windows options:
Download for Windows   AMD64 (ankit dell laptop ye hai) and  ARM64



two types of processor used: In simple terms:

*   **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices):** A company that mainly designs processors using the x86 architecture, which is commonly found in desktop and laptop computers.
*   **ARM (Advanced RISC Machines):** A company that designs processors based on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture. ARM designs are widely used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and increasingly in laptops and servers due to their energy efficiency.




From the screenshot you provided, your laptop is using an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor. This is an Intel processor, so it is an AMD64 (x64) architecture, not ARM64.
For Docker Desktop, you should download the version for Windows - AMD64.

step 1 â€“ Install
Always install Docker Desktop in C: (default, no option to change).

ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€“ Change global container/image storage

D:\IITP_Lab_Software\311_CloudCompDocker\data



Step 3 â€“ Per-project storage (optional)
If you want different projects to store their containers/volumes separately on D:, you can:
Use Docker volumes with a custom path:
docker run -v D:\Project1Data:/data myimage
docker run -v D:\Project2Data:/data myimage

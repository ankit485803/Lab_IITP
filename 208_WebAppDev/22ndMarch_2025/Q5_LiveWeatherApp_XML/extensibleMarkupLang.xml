learn how Extensible Markup Language (XML) work 

XML and HTML are markup languages, XML is used for data storage and transportation, 
while HTML is used for displaying content on web pages. They serve different purposes,
 with XML being more about structure and data exchange and HTML focusing on presentation and layout in web browsers.

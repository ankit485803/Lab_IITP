WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is used by developers and users to run a complete Linux environment directly on Windows, 
enabling the use of Linux command-line tools, utilities, and applications without needing a separate virtual machine or a dual-boot setup

# WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, a feature in Windows that allows you to run a GNU/Linux environment, including 
# command-line tools and applications, directly on your Windows machine without needing a traditional virtual machine or a 
# dual-boot setup. It enables developers and other users to access the power of both Windows and Linux simultaneously, making 
# it easier to use Linux tools for development, administration, and other tasks on a Windows computer


GNU stands for "GNU's Not UNIX". It's a recursive acronym, meaning the acronym contains itself. GNU is a free operating system developed by the GNU Project, aiming to give users freedom to use, study, modify, and share software. When combined with the Linux kernel, it creates the GNU/Linux operating system.

Q. diff b/w Unix (old) and Linux (new), similar like in window OS : command prompt CL and Powershell PS terminal



# A .sh file is a shell script. It's a text file containing a list of commands that a command-line interpreter (the "shell") runs. 
# These scripts are commonly used on Unix-like systems like Linux and macOS.

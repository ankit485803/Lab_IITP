total five ques

write the WSL MNT linux Ubuntu terminal bash shell scripting code for the ques below:



Program1: Initialize an array of numbers, e.g., (5 10 15 20 25). Write a script to calculate and print the sum of all elements. 
Use a for loop to iterate through the array. Also print the average of numbers.

Program2: Use grep to search and count words in a file. Ask the user for a filename and a word to search. Use grep -wo "$word" "$file" to count occurrences. Display: Word found X times in file. 
Handle the case when the file doesnot exist (using if [ -f "$file" ]). Use wc -l to count  matching lines.


Problem3: Student Grades using Arrays and Functions Create two arrays: names=(Alice Bob Charlie), marks=(78 85 92) 
Write a function print_results() that: Prints each student’s name and mark. Prints the highest mark using array comparison.


Program4: Combine string input and grep for file searching. Ask the user to enter a directory path and a keyword. Search all .txt files 
in that directory for the keyword using: grep -r --include="*.txt" "$keyword" "$dir" Display how many files contain the keyword and list their names. 
If no match is found, print "No matching files found." Use grep -l to print only filenames with matches






Program5: Write a function that analyzes a word entered by the user. Ask the user to input a word. 
Create a function analyze_word() that: Prints the length of the word. Prints the word in uppercase. 
Prints the reversed word. Call the function and display results neatly. Use ${#str}, ${str^^}, and a loop to reverse.

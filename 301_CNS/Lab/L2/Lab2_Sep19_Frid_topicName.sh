Gedit is a free and easy-to-use text editor for Linux, especially on systems using the GNOME desktop environment (like Ubuntu).
 Its good for both coding and general
 writing because it highlights code syntax, has a simple design, and includes useful features such as a file browser, 
 search/replace, and autosave. You can also add more functions with plugins. Note that Gedit was replaced as
  the default GNOME text editor by a newer application called "GNOME Text Editor" starting with GNOME 42 in 2022. 
  The provided information also mentions a video showing how to install Gedit on Kali Linux.

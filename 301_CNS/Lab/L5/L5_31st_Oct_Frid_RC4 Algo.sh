RC4 algo and PublicKey Cryptography




DH Key exchange between two clients through server without exposing clients secret to the server

RC4 to generate random byte stream at client 1 and client 2 which act as secrets for respective clients. 
Then DH key exchange with these secrets is done by two clients through server


Finally the shared key is used to send encrypted data between clients without disclosing the actual message. 
Server will able to see the encrypted data. Client 2 having the shared key will able to decrypt the data
